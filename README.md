I was tired of paying attention to git command's syntax everytime I had to push the code. So I build this tool, according to git commands I used to use (sticking to my command formats for tag).

How to use : 
  1) Fill in the input elements with the placeholder details.
  2) Hit the green button.
  3) You can copy the generated git command using the corresponding "Copy" button beside it.
