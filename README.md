# Generate Git Commands

### A small tool to generate git commands.

Actually I was tired of paying attention to `git` command's syntax everytime I had to push the code. So I build this tool, according to `git` commands I used to use (sticking to my command formats for tag).

### How to use : 
1. Fill in the input fields according to the placeholder details.
2. Hit the green button.
3. You can `copy` the generated `git` command using the corresponding "Copy" button beside it.
